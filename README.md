Joined vercel site hosting service:  

- https://vercel.com  

...to which I connected this GitHub code repository...  

- https://github.com/pramnora/vercel    

...and, was given a URL address to view seeing the GitHub Repo running 'live' on the internet...  

- https://vercel-pramnora.vercel.app  

Apparently, signing up for personal a/c's is FREE; as is the (https://) certificate prefix to your site.
