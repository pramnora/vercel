Joined vercel site hosting service:  

- https://vercel.com  

...to which I connected this GitHub code repository...  

- https://github.com/pramnora/vercel    

...and, was given a URL address to view seeing the GitHub Repo running 'live' on the internet...  

- https://vercel-pramnora.vercel.app  

Apparently, signing up for personal a/c's is FREE; as is the (https://) certificate prefix to your site.

## How to create a FREE Web site from Vercel

1> Go to their web site...and, sign up using your email  

2> They will send to your phone a code for you to join   

3> Check your phone for the code...; and, then, type it in   
   (and, basically, that's it, you're a Vercel member, now)  

4> Inside of Vercel site, choose the option link GitHub a/c.;  
    
5> Select a GitHub repository to display.  

6> You will be given a URL address to go and view seeing the web site 'live'.  

-(**NOTE**: At first, I was very deeply worried about running up any extra charges.../which I can't even afford to pay for...?!  
However, if you sign up for a *personal* a/c.; then, the web site hosting is all for FREE...!)-
