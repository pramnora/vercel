I joined web site hosting service: Vercel.com 
very early this morning: 1 AM - 2 AM;
having gone and created a personal FREE a/c.

Connected my GitHub code repository...which is, also, called: Vercel;
and, was given the following URL address to go and view the site: 

https://vercel-pramnora.vercel.com

...everything seems to be fully up and working.

-----

The original web page I had created said, simply, using plain text: index.html:
Test page.
...then, when I awoke, later on...2 PM;
I decided to add more onto the site using proper: HTML/CSS.

-----

I also divided up the site into being separate sections:

index.html
[resources]/[css]/css01.css
[admin]/[logs]/[2002]/[09]/[12]/log.txt
